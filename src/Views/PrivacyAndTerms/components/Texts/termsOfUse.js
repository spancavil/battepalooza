(“Forte”), and licensed to us. For the avoidance of doubt, Forte does not exert any control over you or the Service. You may be permitted to purchase such Digital Assets from us, Provenance Technologies, Inc. (“PTI”), or other users via the Service. 

1.2. Ownership and Transfer of Coins. Your purchase of a Coin through the Service results in your owning that Coin. Your purchase and use of the Coin is subject to these Terms of Use and any other terms you agree to as part of the Coin purchase, in connection with the Service, or in connection with your relationship with Forte, PTI, any third party payment processors related to the Service or the Digital Assets, or any of their affiliates, partners, contractors, or representatives (collectively the “Service Providers”). Your transfer of Coins outside the Service is subject to, limited by, and controlled by the functionality of Service and the Forte Exchange and applicable Service Provider terms of service and policies including but not limited to privacy policies. 

1.3. NFT Limitations. Your acquisition of an NFT through the Service results in a license grant to you for the right to control such NFT, but does not include the grant of any intellectual property rights in such Digital Asset, all of which remain with the original author(s) of such NFTs. Except as set forth below, you may use or resell the NFT as you choose and as allowed by the functionality of the Service. Immediately following any sale of an NFT by you, your right to use and possess the NFT and any associated licenses provided under these Battlepalooza Terms & Conditions of Use will terminate. Your receipt of, and the transfer of rights to, the NFT is subject to your agreeing to these Terms of Use. 

1.4. NFT License. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms of Use and others agreements that are applicable to the Service or your acquisition of the NFT (including but not limited agreements or terms of service put forth by Service Providers), the nWay grants you, solely for your personal, non-commercial use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in connection with a sale of such NFT), non-sublicensable, revocable license to use any intellectual property (or related intellectual property rights) included in the Digital Asset (“NFT IP”) solely as included in the Digital Asset. For clarity, except for the foregoing license, neither your payment for the right to use a Digital Asset nor these Terms of Use grant you any other license or rights to any NFT IP. 

1.5. License and Use Restrictions. Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not: 
1.5.1. Profit from, otherwise commercialize, or license the Digital Asset, including in connection with the marketing, advertising, or selling of any third-party product, except as part of a sale of such Digital Asset; 
1.5.2. Modify the NFT in any way except with permission from the owner of the NFT IP; 
1.5.3. Use the Digital Asset in any manner that infringes upon the intellectual property rights of any third party; 
1.5.4. Use or exploit the Digital Asset in a manner that is considered gambling in the jurisdiction in which you use or exploit the Digital Asset;

1.5.6. Commit any of the foregoing actions with respect to the NFT IP; 
1.5.7. Use the NFT IP except as incorporated in the NFT; or 
1.5.8. Encourage or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing.

1.6. NFTs Not Redeemable or Exchangeable Outside the Game. NFTs are not redeemable or exchangeable for fiat currency, monetary value, or convertible virtual currency from us or any other third party, except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use or otherwise required by applicable law. Transactions involving the exchange of NFTs or other virtual products or services on the Service are not legally enforceable, may not form the basis of any private right of action against the Company or any third party, and are governed solely by the Company in our sole discretion and application of these Terms of Use. 

1.7. Final Payment. All payments for Digital Assets are final and not refundable or exchangeable, except as required by applicable law. You may not transfer, assign, sell, gift, exchange, trade, convert, lease, sublicense, rent, or distribute Digital Assets except through the Service and as expressly permitted by us. Any disposition or attempted disposition of Digital Assets in violation of these Terms of Use will be void and will result in immediate termination of your account and your license to use Digital Assets provided under these Terms of Use. Except for the Service Providers, we do not recognize or condone any third-party services that may be used to sell, exchange, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Digital Assets. We do not assume any responsibility for, and will not support, such transactions. 

1.8. No Obligation. Neither the Company nor the Service Providers nor any other third party has any obligation to exchange Digital Assets for anything of value, including, but not limited to, fiat currency, except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use or otherwise required by applicable law. 

1.9. Security. You are solely responsible for creating a strong password and maintaining adequate security and control of any and all private keys, IDs, passwords, hints, personal identification numbers (PINs), API keys or any other codes that you use to access the Service, your digital wallets, or any Digital Assets. Any loss or compromise of the foregoing information or your personal information may result in unauthorized access to your account by third-parties and the loss or theft of any Digital Assets stored in your digital wallets, including your linked bank account(s) and credit card(s). The Company and the Service Providers assume and have no responsibility for any losses that you may sustain or actions that may occur due to compromise of your private keys or login credentials. 

1.10. Forte Platform. The Company and the Service relies upon the Forte-provided platform to enable all blockchain and Digital Asset functionality. You agree that, if the Company’s relationship with or access to the Forte platform terminates for any reason, neither Forte nor PTI have any responsibility for any losses or liabilities that may occur, directly or indirectly, as a result of such termination (including impacts on the valuation or liquidity of your Digital Assets). 

1.11. Valuation of Digital Assets and Assumption of Risk. The prices and value of Digital Assets are volatile and subjective. Digital Assets and similar assets have no inherent or intrinsic value. The Company and Forte do not and cannot guarantee that any Digital Assets purchased or acquired by you will retain their original value or have any particular value. You agree to assume all risk associated with the use and value of the Digital Assets. You also acknowledge and agree that we may engage in actions that may impact the perceived value or acquired price of Digital Assets at any time, except as prohibited by applicable law. 

1.12. Taxes. It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to the Digital Assets and any transactions you conduct through the Service, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. 

1.13. DIGITAL ASSET DISCLAIMERS. DIGITAL ASSETS ARE INTANGIBLE VIRTUAL ASSETS THAT EXIST BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE BLOCKCHAIN (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PRIVATE SIDECHAINS, L-1 & GAMECHAINS).

THE STRUCTURE, FUNCTIONALITY, DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN USED TO SUPPORT THE SERVICE IS AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF FORTE AND BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FORTE HAS NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE SAME.

1.14. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.

2. USE OF THE APP; ACCOUNT SET-UP AND SECURITY

(i) Account and Wallet Set-Up. To most easily use the App, you should first install a web browser (such as the Google Chrome web browser). You will also need to use the Blocto electronic wallet or another supported electronic wallet, which will enable you to purchase and store collectibles that you collect or purchase via the App. Each collectible is a Non-Fungible Token (an “NFT”) on the Forte blockchain network (the “Forte Platform”). 

(ii) Account Registration. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update your account information as necessary.  We reserve the right to reclaim usernames without liability to you.

(iii) Account Security. You are responsible for the security of your account for the App and for your electronic wallets. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at support@nwayplay.com

(iv) Account Transactions.  You can use your electronic wallet to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using your credit card or USD Coin, a digital stablecoin that is pegged to the United States dollar. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Forte Platform. You understand that your Forte Platform public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.

3. PURCHASING AND EARNING YOUR NFTS  

(i) Acquiring NFTs. The App allows you to purchase, earn, collect and showcase NFTs (each, a “NFT”).  Each NFT is on the Forte Platform. 

(ii) Purchasing NFTs. You can purchase NFTs in two ways: (a) by buying packs of NFTs from us on the App (each, a “Box”); or (b) by buying NFTs from other users in the App’s marketplace (the “Marketplace”). There are different types of Packs available for purchase on the App, and we reserve the right to modify the types, prices and numbers of Packs available at our discretion. Depending on the type of Box you buy, you will collect NFTs of varying levels of scarcity.  Before you buy a Box, we will let you know the types of NFTs (but not the exact NFTs) that are contained in that Box.  If you buy an individual NFT from another user in the Marketplace, you will know the exact NFT that you are purchasing. We strongly encourage you not to purchase NFTs other than in Packs or on the Marketplace.  If you decide to purchase NFTs in any other way, you understand that such purchases will be entirely at your sole risk. 

(iii) Earning NFTs. From time to time, we may offer opportunities for you to earn NFTs by participating in certain challenges or marketing campaigns on the App, or by completing certain in-App tasks.

(iv) Characteristics of NFTs. NFTs are comprised of exclusive content, and the types of content will vary. For example, and without limitation, the content may be comprised of a digital image, a video, and set of data and information associated with the digital collectible.  Each NFT has a defined set of attributes – including scarcity – which help determine the value of the NFT. 

(v) Subjectivity of NFTs. The value of each NFT is inherently subjective, in the same way the value of other collectibles is inherently subjective. Each NFT has no inherent or intrinsic value. Some collectors might prefer to have an NFT featuring certain characteristics, while another might prefer an equivalent NFT featuring different characteristics.  Each collection can have more than one NFT associated with them, and those NFTs will each have different characteristics.

4.  PAYMENT, GAS FEES, TAXES, RELEASE OF PURCHASED NFTS, AND KYC REQUIREMENTS

(i) Financial Transactions on App. Any payments or financial transactions that you engage in via the App will be conducted solely through the Forte Platform.  We have no control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions. We have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any payments or transactions that you engage in via the App, or any other payment or transactions that you conduct via the Forte Platform. We do not provide refunds for any purchases that you might make on or through the App – whether for NFTs, Packs, or anything else.

(ii) Gas Fees. Every transaction on the Forte Platform requires the payment of a transaction fee (each, a “Gas Fee”). The Gas Fees fund the network of computers that run the decentralized Forte Platform. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that you instigate via the App. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms, you will be solely responsible to pay any Gas Fee for any transaction that you instigate via the App.

(iii) Responsibility for Taxes. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, the “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App. Except for income taxes levied on us, you: (a) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (b) will not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments (including Gas Fees) made to us pursuant to these Terms.

(iii) Release of NFT after Purchase. After you purchase an NFT on the App, it may take up to 3 days for the NFT to be released to you. Before the NFT is released to you, you will not be able to trade or take any actions with respect to the NFT.       

(iv) KYC Requirements. You will be required to satisfactorily complete an identity verification process in connection with know-your-customer (KYC) legal requirements prior to effecting certain actions or transactions.  These include, but are not necessarily limited to:
• 	withdrawing fiat currency from your account to a U.S. bank;
• 	transactions greater than a certain amount (currently set to $3,000, but subject to change at our sole discretion);
• 	depositing over $10,000 in value over the life of your account; and
• 	accumulating a balance of over $2,000 in value during the course of a single day.

KYC re-screening may also be required after certain events, such as changing your personal information (e.g., name, address, etc.).  Further, and in addition to any KYC requirements, we may delay withdrawals for up to 2 weeks at our sole discretion for purposes of deterring fraudulent users or activities and/or for other reasons. 

5.  OWNERSHIP, LICENSE, AND OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS

YOUR OWNERSHIP OF NFTS WILL ONLY BE RECOGNIZED BY US IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE RIGHTFULLY ACQUIRED SUCH NFTS FROM A LEGITIMATE SOURCE AND NOT THROUGH ANY OF THE CATEGORY B PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES (AS DEFINED BELOW IN SECTION 5).

For the purposes of this Section 5, the following capitalized terms will have the following meanings: 

“Art” means any art, design, and drawings (in any form or media, including, without limitation, video or digital images) that may be associated with an NFT that you Own.

“Own” means, with respect to an NFT, an NFT that you have purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired from a legitimate source (and not through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities (as defined below)), where proof of such purchase is recorded on the Forte Platform.

“Purchased NFT” means an NFT that you Own. 

“Third Party IP” means any third party patent rights (including, without limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world.

(i) Ownership of NFT.  Because each NFT is on the Forte Platform, when you purchase an NFT in accordance with these Terms (and not through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities (as defined below in Section 5)), you own the underlying NFT completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Forte Platform. Except as otherwise permitted by these Terms in cases where we determine that the NFT has not been rightfully acquired from a legitimate source (including, without limitation, through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities), at no point will we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any NFT.

(ii) We Own the App.  You acknowledge and agree that we (or, as applicable, our licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to all other elements of the App, and all intellectual property rights therein (including, without limitation, all Art, designs, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, “look and feel”, organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the App (collectively, the “App Materials”)).  You acknowledge that the App Materials are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws. All App Materials are the copyrighted property of us or our licensors, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names associated with the App or otherwise contained in the App Materials are proprietary to us or our licensors.

(iii) No User License or Ownership of App Materials. Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of the App does not grant you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other App Materials that you may access on or through the App. We reserve all rights in and to the App Materials that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms.

(iv) Further User Ownership Acknowledgements. For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (a) that your purchase of an NFT, whether via the App or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the App Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the associated Art) other than those expressly contained in these Terms; (b) that you do not have the right, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any elements of the App Materials (including, without limitation, any Art) without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion; and (c) that you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use any of our trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion.

(v)  User License to Art.  Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased NFTs, solely for the following purposes: (a) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (b) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Purchased NFTs, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (c) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Purchased NFT, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT’s owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the website/application. 

(vi) Restrictions on Ownership.  You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without our (or, as applicable, our licensors’) express prior written consent in each case: (a) modify the Art for your Purchased NFT in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (b) use the Art for your Purchased NFT to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (c) use the Art for your Purchased NFT in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (d) use the Art for your Purchased NFT in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in these Terms or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (e) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased NFT; (f) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art for your Purchased NFT; or (g) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased NFT for your or any third party’s commercial benefit.

(vii) Third Party IP. If the Art associated with your Purchased NFT contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property), you understand and agree as follows: (a) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein; (b) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, we may need to (and reserve every right to) pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (c) to the extent that we inform you of such additional restrictions in writing, you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of the license contained in this Section 4.

(viii) Other Terms of License.  The license granted in Section 4(v) above applies only to the extent that you continue to Own the applicable Purchased NFT. If at any time you sell, swap, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased NFT for any reason, the license granted in Section 4(v) will immediately expire with respect to that NFT without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for that NFT. The restrictions in Sections 4(vii) and 4(viii) will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.

(ix) User  Feedback.  You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the App, including without limitation about how to improve the App (collectively, “Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.

If you engage in any of the Prohibited Activities, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, without notice or liability to you, and without limiting any of our other rights or remedies at law or in equity, immediately suspend or terminate your user account and/or delete your NFTs’ images and descriptions from the App. If we delete your NFTs’ images and descriptions from the App, such deletion will not affect your ownership rights in any NFTs that you already Own, but you will not receive a refund of any amounts you paid for those NFTs. 

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, HOWEVER, IF WE REASONABLY BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED IN ANY OF THE CATEGORY B PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES, IN ADDITION TO OUR RIGHT TO IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND OR TERMINATE YOUR USER ACCOUNT AND/OR DELETE YOUR NFTS’ IMAGES AND DESCRIPTIONS FROM THE APP, WE ALSO RESERVE THE RIGHT, AT OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY TO YOU, TO TAKE ANY OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS: (A) TO DEEM ANY TRANSACTION THAT TOOK PLACE VIA OR AS THE RESULT OF SUCH ACTIVITIES TO BE VOID AB INITIO; AND/OR (B) TO IMMEDIATELY CONFISCATE ANY NFTS THAT WERE PURCHASED OR ACQUIRED AS THE RESULT OF SUCH ACTIVITIES.

7. TERMINATION

(i) You Terminate. You may terminate these Terms at any time by canceling your account on the App and discontinuing your access to and use of the App. If you cancel your account, or otherwise terminate these Terms, you will not receive any refunds for any purchases that you might make on or through the App – whether for NFTs, Packs, or anything else.

(ii) We Terminate. You agree that we, in our sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate these Terms and suspend and/or terminate your account(s) for the App without the provision of prior notice. You agree that any suspension or termination of your access to the App may be without prior notice, and that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such suspension or termination.

(iii) Other Remedies Available. If we terminate these Terms or suspend or terminate your access to or use of the App due to your breach of these Terms or any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity (including, without limitation, if you engage in any of the Prohibited Activities), then termination of these Terms will be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity.

(iv) Referral to Governmental Authority. We have the right, without provision of prior notice, to take appropriate legal action, including, without limitation, referral to law enforcement or regulatory authority, or notifying the harmed party of any illegal or unauthorized use of the App. Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone using the App.

(v) Effect of Termination. Upon any termination or expiration of these Terms, whether by you or us, you may no longer have access to information that you have posted on the App or that is related to your account, and you acknowledge that we will have no obligation to maintain any such information in our databases or to forward any such information to you or to any third party. Sections 1 and 3 through 17 will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms for any reason.

YOU WAIVE AND HOLD US AND OUR PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES AND OUR AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, CONTRACTORS, LICENSORS, LICENSEES, SUPPLIERS, AND SUCCESSORS HARMLESS FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY US AND ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES RELATING TO ANY INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER US OR SUCH PARTIES OR BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

8. DISCLAIMERS

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THAT THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE APP AND ANY PART OF IT, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, WE, OUR PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT: (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE APP WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; (II) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR; (III) USAGE DATA PROVIDED THROUGH THE APP WILL BE ACCURATE; (IV) THE APP OR ANY CONTENT, SERVICES, OR FEATURES MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE APP ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; OR (V) THAT ANY DATA THAT YOU DISCLOSE WHEN YOU USE THE APP WILL BE SECURE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET, AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.

WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU INCUR AS THE RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE FORTE PLATFORM, OR YOUR ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (I) USER ERROR, SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS OR INCORRECTLY CONSTRUED SMART CONTRACTS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS; (II) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (III) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES; OR (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR ACTIVITIES BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTE-FORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE APP, THE FORTE PLATFORM, OR ANY ELECTRONIC WALLET.

NFTS ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS THAT EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE FORTE PLATFORM. ALL SMART CONTRACTS ARE CONDUCTED AND OCCUR ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE FORTE PLATFORM. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND MAKE NO GUARANTEES OR PROMISES WITH RESPECT TO SMART CONTRACTS.

WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES DUE TO BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE FORTE PLATFORM, OR ANY ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING THE FORTE PLATFORM, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE, OUR PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH YOU MAY INCUR, HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

NWAY’S AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE APP, AND THE NFTs, FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF (A) FIFTY US DOLLARS ($50) OR (B) THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID NWAY IN THE TWO (2) MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE FIRST CLAIM GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,  DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN US AND YOU AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US AND YOU. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APP TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations in this section may not apply to you.

10. ASSUMPTION OF RISK

(i) Value and Volatility. The prices of collectible blockchain assets are extremely volatile and subjective and collectible blockchain assets have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. Each NFT has no inherent or intrinsic value. We cannot guarantee that any NFTs purchased will retain their original value, as the value of collectibles is inherently subjective and factors occurring outside of the Battlepalooza ecosystem may materially impact the value and desirability of any particular NFT.

(ii) Tax Calculations. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App.

(iii) Use of Blockchain. The App does not store, send, or receive NFTs. This is because NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain in the Forte Platform. Any transfer of NFTs occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Forte Platform, and not on the App.

(iv) Inherent Risks with Internet Currency. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Forte Platform, however caused.

(v) Regulatory Uncertainty. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Battlepalooza ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your NFTs.

(vi) Software Risks. Upgrades to the Forte Platform, a hard fork in the Forte Platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Forte Platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the Forte Platform’s NFT standard, including the Battlepalooza ecosystem.  

11. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to hold harmless and indemnify us and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost and attorneys' fees arising out of or in any way related to: (i) your breach of these Terms; (ii) your misuse of the App; or (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App. You agree that we will have control of the defense or settlement of any such claims.

12. EXTERNAL SITES

The App may include hyperlinks to other websites or resources (collectively, the “External Sites”), which are provided solely as a convenience to our users. We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or made available from or through any External Sites. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any External Sites.

13. FORCE MAJEURE

(i) Force Majeure Events. We will not be liable or responsible to the you, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of these Terms, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from the following force majeure events (“Force Majeure Event(s)”): (a) acts of God; (b) flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, pandemics, including the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), tsunami, explosion; (c) war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest; (d) government order, law, or action; (e) embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date of this agreement; (f) strikes, labour stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances; (g) shortage of adequate or suitable Internet connectivity, telecommunication breakdown or shortage of adequate power or electricity; and (h) other similar events beyond our control.

(ii) Performance During Force Majeure Events. If we suffer a Force Majeure Event, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify you of the Force Majeure Event, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue. We will use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized. We will resume the performance of our obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the removal of the cause. In the event that our failure or delay remains uncured for a period of forty-five (45) consecutive days following written notice given by us under this Section 12, we may thereafter terminate these Terms upon fifteen (15) days' written notice.

14. CHANGES TO THE APP

We are constantly innovating the App to help provide the best possible experience. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the App, and any part of it, may change from time to time without prior notice to you, and that we may add new features and change any part of the App at any time without notice.

15. CHILDREN

You affirm that you are over the age of 18.  The App is not intended for children under 18.  If you are under the age of 18, you may not use the App.  We do not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under the age of 18.  If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 18, we will unfortunately have to close your account.  Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use the App. 

16. PRIVACY POLICY

Our Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information, and is hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION

YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY.

YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.

(i) Binding Arbitration. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this contract, or in respect of any defined legal relationship associated therewith or derived therefrom, shall be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, State of California, USA.  Arbitration will be under the auspices of, and pursuant to the rules of, the American Arbitration Association’s Commercial Arbitration Rules as then in effect.  

(ii) Arbitration Fees. Each party will cover its own fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceedings; however, if the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the fees and costs reasonably associated with the arbitration proceedings, we will pay them for you.

(iii) Award Enforcement. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that they will not appeal any arbitration decision to any court.

(iv) Our Equitable Remedies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek and obtain injunctive relief in any jurisdiction in any court of competent jurisdiction, and you agree that these Terms are specifically enforceable by us through injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary damages.

18. GENERAL

(i) Entire Agreement.  These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy (which are incorporated herein by reference), constitute the entire legal agreement between you and us and will be deemed to be the final and integrated agreement between you and us, and govern your access to and use of the App, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and us related to your access to or use of the App, whether oral or written.

(ii) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than you

(iii) Interpretation. The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party.

(v) No Waivers. Our failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute or be deemed a waiver of future exercise or enforcement of such right or provision. The waiver of any right or provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed for and on behalf of us by a duly authorized representative.

(vi) Governing Law. All matters arising out of or relating to these Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA.

(vii) Venue. Subject to Section 16 of these Terms, any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the courts in San Francisco County in the State of California, and we and you irrevocably consent and attorn to the personal jurisdiction and venue there.

(viii) Notices. We may provide you with any notices (including, without limitation those regarding changes to these Terms) by email or postings on the App. By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices.
